# ActivityTracker - Outside4Life
This is a group project completed by Scott Christensen, Tony McKendry, Corey Yaspan and Tommy Pasque in the g18 Galvanize Full Stack Program.  The project was completed for Avid4 (http://www.avid4.com/), who is a nonprofit located in Boulder and San Francisco.  The application is a prototype that offers their current user base a digital platform to track, share and encourage outdoor activity participation.  The MVP allows the user to login via Facebook OAuth.  Upon login, the user will be prompted with the purpose of the website and will then be allowed to add posts which include pictures of their child's outdoor activity with the amount of hours for the outdoor participation.  From there, Avid4 can award prizes to the individual users if they meet their annual goal of 100 points (1 point = 1 hour of outdoor activity).  Hours are tracked by the parent and are submitted on the honor system.  

Avid4 has a built in Admin Page as well where they can view user emails as well as their current progress towards their goal.

Last but not least, the website is built to be mobile responsive and can act on most smart phone devices.
